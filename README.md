# MA2-zakljuƒçno nalogo
Some code for my Final Model Analysis II report:

ma20131 - heat transfer via conduction;\
The domain is a square and we have Dirichlet b.c. at the left and right edge, at top and bottom of the domain we have Neumann b.c.\
We get the solution with the Finite Difference Method.

ma20132 - heat transfer via natural convection;\
The domain is a square and we have two fluids with different parameters, the grid is staggered.\
We get the velocity by solving the Navier-Stokes equations with the MAC method, then use this in the energy (temperature) equation.
