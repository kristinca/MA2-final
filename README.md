# MA2-zakljuƒçno nalogo
Some code for my Final Modal Analysis 2 report:

ma20131 - heat transfer via conduction;

ma20132 - heat transfer via natural convection;
The domain is a square and we have two fluids with different parameters, the grid is staggered.
We get the velocity by solving the Navier-Stokes equations with the MAC method, then use this in the energy (temperature) equation.
